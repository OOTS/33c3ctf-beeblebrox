# 33c3ctf-beeblebrox
This repository contains the code and my solution for the beeblebrox challenge from 33C3CTF.

Make bad politicians resign!

Note that my solution can take one or two hours to complete.
Others have produced far more optimized solutions, which may take only
minutes.
Since my solution takes quite long, I've programmed it to repeatedly
store some intermediate results, in case it needs to restart.

I've also provided a few hints that we were ready to give during the CTF,
but didn't have to give.

Note: The primes P and Q were supposed to be *safe* primes,
but due to some apparent #fail by me, they weren't.
However, as far as I know, this has not had any effect on the challenge.
